            I am currently taking my web developing course at GoMyCode.
            Engaging with other ful stack developers has really opened up my
            mind As a junior full-stack developer, my passion for web
            development is driven by the desire to be a creator rather than
            just a consumer. I am dedicated to mastering the intricacies of
            the web, from front-end design to back-end functionality, with the
            ultimate goal of wielding the power to bring my ideas to life. I
            thrive on the sense of empowerment that comes from transforming
            concepts into tangible, functional applications. My journey is
            marked by a commitment to continuous learning, staying abreast of
            industry trends, and honing my skills to contribute meaningfully
            to the world of web development. Eager to take on challenges and
            create innovative solutions, I bring a blend of technical
            expertise and creative vision to every project I undertake.

            <h3>junior web developer</h3>
            <p>
            As a seasoned software developer, I have dedicated myself to crafting efficient and innovative solutions that address complex challenges in the digital landscape. My experience spans across full-stack development, where I've adeptly navigated both frontend and backend technologies to deliver high-quality applications. Leveraging my expertise in languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Java, I've contributed to the development of robust web applications, employing frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.js to ensure seamless user experiences. My role has often involved collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, where I've led the design and implementation of RESTful APIs and integrated various third-party services to enhance functionality. Whether it's debugging intricate code or devising scalable architectures, my approach remains rooted in meticulous problem-solving and a commitment to delivering results that exceed expectations. Through continuous learning and staying abreast of emerging technologies, I remain driven to push the boundaries of what's possible in software development.

<p>I have been priviledged to work with some of the most prestigous tech companies both locally and international. My first work was in Britam where i was first aquinted to the working life style of a software developer.
    it started out as an internship but later on i was employed due to my outstanding skills. At first it was never easy, being a junior web-developer people doubted my opinions, insight and also my ability and for this i set out to prove them wrong.</p>

            <p>After a few years of working with the Britam insurance company as a back-end web developer, I later went on to work with Microsoft as software developer. I most dealt with their back-end servers and with a great team I was able to grow alot and develop more both as a developer and as  collegue</p>
